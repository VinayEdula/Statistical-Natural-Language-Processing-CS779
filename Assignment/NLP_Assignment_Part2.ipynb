        "\n",
        "### Steps in KNN Classification:\n",

        "1. Separate the corpus into documents and tokenize each document. Create a dictionary of tokens with index assigned to each token.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Represent each document using a TF-IDF vector. Essentially, each document can be represented as vector where index of each element corresponds to index in the  vocabulary/dictionary and it's value corresponds to TF-IDF value of the corresponding token. If your dataset is large, consider using efficient vectorization techniques or libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### KNN Implementation **[20 + 500 marks]**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Calculate Distances:** Implement a function to compute the distance between TF-IDF vectors. Ensure you handle vector normalization if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Predict Labels:** Develop a function that uses the k-nearest neighbors to classify a test document. This involves finding the nearest neighbors and determining the most common class label. Note if you do comparisons in brute-force manner it may result in $O(N^2)$ complexity which may not be scalable.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Testing Different Values of `k`:** Experiment with different values of `k` (2, 10) and observe how they affect the classification performance. Compute the following performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) for each value of `k`. Plot accuracy vs `k` and F1-score vs `k` curves. What are your main observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Distance Metrics:** Above you already tried euclidean distance, try out different distance metrics such as  Manhattan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), and Cosine similarity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), to see how they affect classification results.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Comparative Analysis:** Implement KNN using library functions (e.g., from scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) and compare the results with your implementation. Is there any differences in performance and efficiency.\n",

        "\n",
        " Lets assume you have a large datasets, direct k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) can be computationally expensive. Consider implementing KNN using atleast two of the following techniques to improve efficiency (You can think and implement some other techniques also) :\n",
        "\n",
        "  - KD-Trees (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree):\n",
        "\n",
        "    KD-Trees are data structures that partition data into k-dimensional spaces. They enable faster nearest neighbor searches by reducing the number of distance calculations needed.\n",

        "  - Ball Trees (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_tree):\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ball Trees organize data points in a hierarchy of nested hyperspheres. They are particularly effective for high-dimensional data where KD-Trees might not be as efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN):\n",
        "\n",
        "    ANN algorithms provide approximate nearest neighbors more quickly than exact methods. Techniques like Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) (https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/locality-sensitive-hashing/) and libraries such as Annoy (https://github.com/spotify/annoy) can be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) or t-SNE (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html#tsne) can reduce the dimensionality of the data, leading to faster distance calculations while preserving essential features.\n",

Founded in 1895 by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and established its first degree courses under the auspices of the university in 1901.[6] LSE began awarding its degrees in its own name in 2008,[7] prior to which it awarded degrees of the University of London. It became a university in its own right within the University of London in 2022.[8]\\nLSE is located in the London Borough of Camden and Westminster, Central London, near the boundary between Covent Garden and Holborn. The area is historically known as Clare Market. LSE has more than 11,000 students, just under seventy percent of whom come from outside the UK, and 3,300 staff.[9] The university has the sixth-largest endowment of any university in the UK and in 2022/23, it had an income of \\u00a3466.1 million of which \\u00a339.6 million was from research grants.[1] Despite its name, the school is organised into 25 academic departments and institutes which conduct teaching and research across a range of pure and applied social sciences.[9]\\nLSE is a member of the Russell Group, Association of Commonwealth Universities and the European University Association, and is typically considered part of the \\\"golden triangle\\\" of research universities in the south east of England. The LSE also forms part of CIVICA \\u2013 The European University of Social Sciences, a network of eight European universities focused on research in the social sciences.[10] In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the school had the third highest grade point average (joint with the University of Cambridge).[11]\\nLSE alumni and faculty include 55 past or present heads of state or government and 18 Nobel laureates. As of 2017, 13 out of 49 Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economics had been awarded to LSE alumni, current staff, or former staff. LSE alumni and faculty have also won 3 Nobel Peace Prizes and 2 Nobel Prizes in Literature.[12][13] The university has educated the most billionaires (11) of any European university according to a 2014 global census of US dollar billionaires.[14]\\nHistory\\n[edit]Origins\\n[edit]The London School of Economics and Political Science was founded in 1895[15] by Beatrice and Sidney Webb,[16] initially funded by a bequest of \\u00a320,000[17][18] from the estate of Henry Hunt Hutchinson. Hutchinson, a lawyer[17] and member of the Fabian Society,[19][20] left the money in trust, to be put \\\"towards advancing its [The Fabian Society's] objects in any way they [the trustees] deem advisable\\\".[20] The five trustees were Sidney Webb, Edward Pease, Constance Hutchinson, W. S. de Mattos and William Clark.[17]\\nLSE records that the proposal to establish the school was conceived during a breakfast meeting on 4 August 1894, between the Webbs, Louis Flood, and George Bernard Shaw.[15] The proposal was accepted by the trustees in February 1895[20] and LSE held its first classes in October of that year, in rooms at 9 John Street, Adelphi,[21] in the City of Westminster.\\n20th century\\n[edit]The school joined the federal University of London in 1900 and was recognised as a Faculty of Economics of the university. The University of London degrees of BSc (Econ) and DSc (Econ) were established in 1901, the first university degrees dedicated to the social sciences.[21] Expanding rapidly over the following years, the school moved initially to the nearby 10 Adelphi Terrace, then to Clare Market and Houghton Street. The foundation stone of the Old Building, on Houghton Street, was laid by King George V in 1920;[15] the building was opened in 1922.[21]\\nThe school's arms,[22] including its motto and beaver mascot, were adopted in February 1922,[23] on the recommendation of a committee of twelve, including eight students, which was established to research the matter.[24] The Latin motto, rerum cognoscere causas, is taken from Virgil's Georgics. Its English translation is \\\"to Know the Causes of Things\\\"[23] and it was suggested by Professor Edwin Cannan.[15] The beaver mascot was selected for its associations with \\\"foresight, constructiveness, and industrious behaviour\\\".[24]\\nThe 1930s economic debate between LSE and the University of Cambridge is well known in academic circles. The rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's Edwin Cannan (1861\\u20131935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, Alfred Marshall (1842\\u20131924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)[25]\\nThe dispute also concerned the question of the economist's role, and whether this should be as a detached expert or a practical adviser.[26] Despite the traditional view that the LSE and Cambridge were fierce rivals through the 1920s and 30s, they worked together in the 1920s on the London and Cambridge Economic Service.[27] However, the 1930s brought a return to disputes as economists at the two universities argued over how best to address the economic problems caused by the Great Depression.[28]\\nThe main figures in this debate were John Maynard Keynes from Cambridge and the LSE's Friedrich Hayek. The LSE economist Lionel Robbins was also heavily involved. Starting off as a disagreement over whether demand management or deflation was the better solution to the economic problems of the time, it eventually embraced much wider concepts of economics and macroeconomics. Keynes put forward the theories now known as Keynesian economics, involving the active participation of the state and public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the Austrian School, which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.[28]\\nDuring World War II, the school decamped from London to the University of Cambridge, occupying buildings belonging to Peterhouse.[29]\\nFollowing the decision to establish a modern business school within the University of London in the mid-1969s, the idea was discussed of setting up a \\\"Joint School of Administration, Economics, and Technology\\\" between the LSE and Imperial College. However, this avenue was not pursued and instead, the London Business School was created as a college of the university.[30]\\nIn 1966, the appointment of Sir Walter Adams as director sparked opposition from the student union and student protests. Adams had previously been principal of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and the students objected to his failure to oppose Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence and cooperation with the white minority government. This broadened into wider concerns about links between the LSE and its governors and investments in Rhodesia and South Africa and concerns over LSE's response to student protests. These led to the closure of the school for 25 days in 1969 after a student attempt to dismantle the school gates resulted in the arrest of over 30 students. Injunctions were taken out against 13 students (nine from LSE), with three students ultimately being suspended, two foreign students being deported, and two staff members seen as supporting the protests being fired.[15][31][32]\\nIn the 1970s, four Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economic Sciences were awarded to economists associated with the LSE: John Hicks (lecturer 1926\\u201336) in 1972, Friedrich Hayek (lecturer 1931\\u201350) in 1974, James Meade (lecturer 1947\\u20131957) in 1977 and Arthur Lewis (BSc Econ 1937, and the LSE's first Black academic 1938\\u201344) in 1979.[15][33][34]\\n21st century\\n[edit]In the early 21st century, the LSE had a wide impact on British politics. The Guardian described such influence in 2005 when it stated:\\nOnce again the political clout of the school, which seems to be closely wired into parliament, Whitehall, and the Bank of England, is being felt by ministers. ... The strength of LSE is that it is close to the political process: Mervyn King, was a former LSE professor. The former chairman of the House of Commons education committee, Barry Sheerman, sits on its board of governors, along with Labour peer Lord (Frank) Judd. Also on the board are Tory MPs Virginia Bottomley and Richard Shepherd, as well as Lord Saatchi and Lady Howe.[35]\\nCommenting in 2001 on the rising status of the LSE, the British magazine The Economist stated that \\\"two decades ago the LSE was still the poor relation of the University of London's other colleges. Now... it regularly follows Oxford and Cambridge in league tables of research output and teaching quality and is at least as well-known abroad as Oxbridge\\\". According to the magazine, the school \\\"owes its success to the single-minded, American-style exploitation of its brand name and political connections by the recent directors, particularly Mr Giddens and his predecessor, John Ashworth\\\" and raises money from foreign students' high fees, which are attracted by academic stars such as Richard Sennett.[36]\\nIn 2006, the school published a report disputing the costs of British government proposals to introduce compulsory ID cards.[37][38][39] LSE academics were also represented on numerous national and international bodies in the early 21st century, including the UK Airports Commission,[40] Independent Police Commission,[41] Migration Advisory Committee,[42] UN Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation,[43] London Finance Commission,[44] HS2 Limited,[45] the UK government's Infrastructure Commission[46] and advising on architecture and urbanism for the London 2012 Olympics[47]\\nThe LSE gained its own degree-awarding powers in 2006 and the first LSE degrees (rather than degrees of the University of London) were awarded in 2008.[15]\\nFollowing the passage of the University of London Act 2018, the LSE (along with other member institutions of the University of London) announced in early 2019 that they would seek university status in their own right while remaining part of the federal university.[48] Approval of university title was received from the Office for Students in May 2022 and updated Articles of Association formally constituting the school as a university were approved by LSE council 5 July 2022.[49][50]\\nControversies\\n[edit]In February 2011, LSE had to face the consequences of matriculating one of Muammar Gaddafi's sons while accepting a \\u00a31.5m donation to the university from his family.[51] LSE director Howard Davies resigned over allegations about the institution's links to the Libyan regime.[52] The LSE announced in a statement that it had accepted his resignation with \\\"great regret\\\" and that it had set up an external inquiry into the school's relationship with the Libyan regime and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, to be conducted by the former lord chief justice Harry Woolf.[52]\\nIn 2013, the LSE was featured in a BBC Panorama documentary on North Korea, filmed inside the repressive regime by undercover journalists attached to a trip by the LSE's Grimshaw Club, a student society of the international relations department. The trip had been sanctioned by high-level North Korean officials.[53][54] The trip caused international media attention as a BBC journalist was posing as a part of LSE.[55] There was debate as to whether this put the students' lives in jeopardy in the repressive regime if a reporter had been exposed.[56] The North Korean government made hostile threats towards the students and LSE after the publicity, which forced an apology from the BBC.[54]\\nIn August 2015, it was revealed that the university was paid approximately \\u00a340,000 for a \\\"glowing report\\\" for Camila Batmanghelidjh's charity, Kids Company.[57] The study was used by Batmanghelidjh to prove that the charity provided good value for money and was well managed. The university did not disclose that the study was funded by the charity.\\nIn 2023, the LSE formally cut ties with the LGBT charity Stonewall, a decision which was sharply criticized as transphobic by the LSE Student Union but praised by gender-critical activists as being conducive to freedom of speech.[58][59]\\nIndustrial Disputes\\n[edit]In the summer of 2017, dozens of campus cleaners contracted via Noonan Services went on weekly strikes, protesting outside key buildings and causing significant disruption during end-of-year examinations.[60] The dispute organised by the UVW union was originally over unfair dismissals of cleaners, but had escalated into a broad demand for decent employment rights matching those of LSE's in-house employees.[61] Owen Jones did not cross the picket line after arriving for a debate on grammar schools with Peter Hitchens.[62] It was announced in June 2018 that some 200 outsourced workers at the LSE would be offered in-house contracts.[63]\\nSince 2014/15, levels of academic casualisation have increased at the LSE, with the number of academics on fixed-term contracts increasing from 47% in 2016/2017 to 59% in 2021/2022,[64] according to Higher Education Statistical Agency data (internal LSE data puts the latest figure at 58.5%).[65] During this same period, comparable universities such as University of Edinburgh, University College London and Imperial all increased their rates of permanent staff relative to those on fixed term contracts.[64] Only Oxford had a higher proportion of casual academic work for the 2021/2022 year (66%) although in contrast to LSE, the proportion remained constant rather than rising.[64] As a result, the student-to-permanent staff ratio at LSE has worsened and had, as of July 2023, the worst student-to-permanent staff ratio among comparable universities in the UK, according to HESA data.[64] According to research conducted by the LSE UCU Branch into staff well-being, 82% of fixed term academic staff at the LSE experienced regular or constant anxiety about their professional futures.[65] In the same survey, overwork and mental health issues were reported as endemic among respondents, with 40% of fellows reporting that their teaching hours exceeded LSE's universal teaching limit of 100 hours per academic year for LSE Fellows.[65]\\nIn response to industrial action, which included not marking student work, taken by UCU in the summer of 2023 over pay and casualised working conditions, the LSE management took the decision to not accept partial performance of duties and to impose pay deductions on academic staff participating in the action.[66] The LSE also introduced an 'Exceptional Degree Classification Schemes' policy,[67] allowing undergraduate and taught postgraduate students to be awarded provisional degrees on the basis of fewer grades than normally required. In the event that the final classification (once all marks are available) is lower than the provisional classification, the higher provisional classification will stand as the degree classification.[67]\\nThe World Turned Upside Down\\n[edit]A sculpture by Mark Wallinger, The World Turned Upside Down, which features a globe resting on its north pole, was installed in Sheffield Street on the LSE campus on 26 March 2019. The artwork attracted controversy for showing Taiwan as a sovereign state rather than as part of China,[68][69][70] Lhasa being denoted as a full capital and depicting boundaries between India and China as recognised internationally. The sculpture also did not depict the State of Palestine as a separate country from Israel.\\nAfter protests and reactions from both Chinese and Taiwanese students,[71][72] The university decided later that year that it would retain the original design which chromatically displayed the PRC and Taiwan as different entities consistent with the status quo, but with the addition of an asterisk beside the name of Taiwan and a corresponding placard that clarified the institution's position regarding the controversy.[73][74]\\nCampus and estate\\n[edit]Since 1902, LSE has been based at Clare Market and Houghton Street (first syllable pronounced \\\"How\\\")[75] in Westminster. It is surrounded by a number of important institutions including the Royal Courts of Justice, all four Inns of Courts, Royal College of Surgeons, Sir John Soane's Museum, and the West End is immediately across Kingsway from campus, which also borders the City of London and is within walking distance to Trafalgar Square and the Houses of Parliament.\\nIn 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the Old Building. The campus now occupies an almost continuous group of around 30 buildings between Kingsway and Aldwych. Alongside teaching and academic space, the institution owns 11 student halls of residence across London, a West End theatre (the Peacock), early years centre, NHS medical centre and extensive sports ground in Berrylands, south London. LSE operates the George IV public house[76] and the students' union operates the Three Tuns bar.[77] The school's campus is noted for its numerous public art installations, which include Richard Wilson's Square the Block,[78] Michael Brown's Blue Rain,[79] Christopher Le Brun's Desert Window,[80] and Turner Prize-winner Mark Wallinger's The World Turned Upside Down.[81][82][83]\\nSince the early 2000s, the campus has undergone an extensive refurbishment project and a major fund-raising \\\"Campaign for LSE\\\" raised over \\u00a3100 million in what was one of the largest university fund-raising exercises outside North America. This process began with the \\u00a335 million renovation of the British Library of Political and Economic Science by Foster and Partners.[84]\\nIn 2003, LSE purchased the former Public Trustee building at 24 Kingsway and engaged Sir Nicholas Grimshaw to redesign it into an ultra-modern educational facility at a total cost of over \\u00a345 million \\u2013 increasing the size of the campus by 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2). The New Academic Building opened for teaching in October 2008, with an official opening by Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on 5 November 2008.[85] In November 2009 the school purchased the adjacent Sardinia House to house three academic departments and the nearby Old White Horse public house, before acquiring the freehold of the grade-II listed Land Registry Building at 32 Lincoln's Inn Fields in October 2010, which was reopened in March 2013 by The Princess Royal as the new home for the Department of Economics, International Growth Centre and its associated economic research centres. In 2015, LSE brought its ownership of buildings on Lincoln's Inn Fields to six, with the purchase of 5 Lincoln's Inn Fields on the north side of the square, which has since been converted into faculty accommodation.[86]\\nSaw Swee Hock Student Centre\\n[edit]The first new campus building for more than 40 years, the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre, named after the Singaporean statistician and philanthropist, opened in January 2014 following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions.[87][88] The building provides accommodation for the LSE Students' Union, LSE accommodation office and LSE careers service as well as a bar, events space, gymnasium, rooftop terrace, learning caf\\u00e9, dance studio, and media centre.[89] Designed by architectural practice O\\u2019Donnell and Tuomey, the building achieved a BREEAM 'Outstanding' rating for environmental sustainability, won multiple awards including the RIBA National Award and London Building of the Year Award, and was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize.[90][91][92][93]\\nCentre Building\\n[edit]The Centre Building, situated opposite the British Library of Political and Economic Science, opened in June 2019. Designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners following a RIBA competition, the 13-storey building includes 14 seminar rooms seating between 20 and 60, 234 study spaces, a 200-seater auditorium, as well as three lecture theatres.[94] The building hosts the School of Public Policy, the Departments of Government and International Relations, the European Institute, and the International Inequalities Institute. It includes publicly accessible roof terraces and a renovated square at the centre of campus.[95][96][97] The building design was recognised with RIBA's London Award and National Award in 2021.[98][99][100][101]\\nMarshall Building\\n[edit]The Marshall Building, located at 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields, opened in January 2022.[102] Designed by Grafton Architects and named after British investor Paul Marshall, the building houses the Departments of Management, Accounting, and Finance, sports facilities, and the Marshall Institute for Philanthropy and Social Entrepreneurship.[103][104][105] The site was previously home to the Francis Crick Institute's laboratories, which LSE purchased in 2013.[106][107]\\nFuture expansion\\n[edit]On 15 November 2017, LSE announced that it acquired the Nuffield Building at 35 Lincoln's Inn Fields from the Royal College of Surgeons and plans to redevelop the site to host the Firoz Lalji Global Hub, the departments of Mathematics, Statistics and Methodology, the Data Science Institute, and conference and executive education facilities. The new building will be designed by David Chipperfield Architects.[108][109][110][111]\\nSustainability\\n[edit]In 2021, LSE claimed to be the first UK university to be independently verified as carbon-neutral, which it achieved by funding rainforest trees to offset emissions through the Finnish organisation (Oy) Compensate.[112][113] However, LSE omitted some of its emissions in its calculation and thus did not offset all of them. While it measured and offset emissions from heating, electricity, and faculty air travel, the school left out other travel-related emissions, as well as emissions from construction and on-campus food. LSE plans to offset the remaining emissions (scope 1 through 3) by 2050.[114][115][116]\\nOrganisation and administration\\n[edit]Governance\\n[edit]Although LSE is a constituent college of the federal University of London, it is in many ways comparable with free-standing, self-governing, and independently funded universities, and it awards its own degrees.\\nLSE is incorporated under the Companies Act as a company limited by guarantee and is an exempt charity within the meaning of Schedule Two of the Charities Act 1993.[117] The principal governance bodies of the LSE are: the LSE Council; the Court of Governors; the academic board; and the director and director's management team.[117]\\nThe LSE Council is responsible for strategy and its members are company directors of the school. It has specific responsibilities in relation to areas including the monitoring of institutional performance; finance and financial sustainability; audit arrangements; estate strategy; human resource and employment policy; health and safety; \\\"educational character and mission\\\", and student experience. The council is supported in carrying out its role by a number of committees that report directly to it.[117]\\nThe Court of Governors deals with certain constitutional matters and has pre-decision discussions on key policy issues and the involvement of individual governors in the school's activities. The court has the following formal powers: the appointment of members of the court, its subcommittees, and the council; election of the chair and vice chairs of the court and council and honorary fellows of the school; the amendment of the memorandum and articles of association; and the appointment of external auditors.[117]\\nThe academic board is LSE's principal academic body and considers all major issues of general policy affecting the academic life of the school and its development. It is chaired by the director, with staff and student membership, and is supported by its own structure of committees. The vice chair of the academic board serves as a non-director member of the council and makes a termly report to the council.[117] Since the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Academic Board has moved online and has not yet returned to in-person meetings, changing the dynamic of engagement.\\nPresident and Vice-Chancellor\\n[edit]The president and vice-chancellor (titled director until 2022) is the head of LSE and its chief executive officer, responsible for executive management and leadership on academic issues. The vice-chancellor reports to and is accountable to the council. The vice-chancellor is also the accountable officer for the purposes of the Office for Students financial memorandum. The LSE's current interim vice-chancellor is Eric Neumayer, who replaced Minouche Shafik on 23 June 2023. In July 2023, the LSE announced that Hewlett Foundation head Larry Kramer would become president and vice-chancellor in April 2024.[118]\\nThe president is supported by four pro-vice chancellors with designated portfolios (education; research; planning and resources; faculty development), the school secretary, the chief operating officer, the chief finance officer, and the chief philanthropy and global engagement officer.[119]\\nYears | Name |\\n---|---|\\n1895\\u20131903 | William Hewins |\\n1903\\u20131908 | Sir Halford Mackinder |\\n1908\\u20131919 | The Hon.

Key sources of income included \\u00a3177M from tuition fees and education contacts (2014\\u201315 \\u00a3167M), \\u00a325M from funding council grants (2014\\u201315 \\u00a322M), \\u00a332M from research grants (2014\\u201315 \\u2013 \\u00a327M) and \\u00a35.3M from investment income (2014\\u201315 \\u00a34.7M).[122]\\nThe Times Higher Education Pay Survey 2017 revealed that, among larger, non-specialist institutions, LSE professors and academics were the highest paid in the UK, with average incomes of \\u00a3103,886 and \\u00a365,177 respectively.[123]\\nEndowment\\n[edit]The London School of Economics (LSE) is aiming to increase the size of its endowment fund to more than \\u00a31bn, which would make it one of the best resourced institutions in the UK and the world. The effort was initiated in 2016 by Lord Myners, then chairman of the LSE's Council and Court of Governors. The plan includes working with wealthy alumni of LSE to make large contributions, increasing the annual budget surplus, and launching a new, widescale alumni donor campaign. The plan to grow LSE's endowment to more than \\u00a31bn has been continued by Lord Myners' successors at the LSE.[124] The LSE has stated that currently \\\"limited endowment funding constrains our ability to offer 'needs blind' admission to students\\\".[122] Between 2015 and 2022, the endowment increased from \\u00a3113 million to \\u00a3229 million.[125][126]\\nAcademic year\\n[edit]LSE continues to adopt a three-term structure and has not moved to semesters. Michaelmas Term runs from October to mid-December, Lent Term from mid-January to late March, and Summer Term from late April to mid-June. Certain departments operate reading weeks in early November and mid-February.[127]\\nLogo, arms and mascot\\n[edit]The school's historic coat of arms is used on official documentation including degree certificates and transcripts and includes the motto \\u2013 rerum cognoscere causas, a line taken from Virgil's Georgics meaning \\\"to know the causes of things\\\", together with the school's mascot \\u2013 a beaver. Both these symbols, adopted in February 1922, continue to be held in high regard to this day with the beaver chosen because of its representation as \\\"a hard-working and industrious yet sociable animal\\\", attributes that the founders hoped LSE students to both possess and aspire to.[128] The school's weekly newspaper is still entitled The Beaver, Rosebery residence hall's bar is called the Tipsy Beaver and LSE sports teams are known as the Beavers.[129] The institution has two sets of colours \\u2013 brand and academic \\u2013 red being the brand colour used on signage, publications and in buildings across campus and purple, black and gold for academic purposes including presentation ceremonies and graduation dress.\\nLSE's present 'red block' logo was modified as part of a rebrand in the early 2000s. As a trademarked brand, it is carefully protected but can be produced in various forms to reflect different requirements.[130] In its full form it contains the full name of the institution to the right of the block with a further small empty red square at the end, but it is adapted for each academic department or professional service division to provide a cohesive brand across the institution.\\nAcademic profile\\n[edit]Admissions\\n[edit]\\n|\\nDomicile[134] and Ethnicity[135] | Total | ||\\n---|---|---|---|\\nBritish White | 16% | ||\\nBritish Ethnic Minorities[a] | 19% | ||\\nInternational EU | 15% | ||\\nInternational Non-EU | 50% | ||\\nUndergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[136][137] | |||\\nFemale | 53% | ||\\nPrivate School | 30% | ||\\nLow Participation Areas[b] | 7% |\\nIn 2023, The LSE received 26,000 applications for roughly 1,800 undergraduate places or 14 applicants per place.[138] All undergraduate applications, including international applications, are made through UCAS.[138] LSE had the 8th highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2021\\u201322, with new students averaging 195 UCAS points, equivalent to just over AAAA in A-level grades.[133] The university gave offers of admission to roughly 12.2% of its undergraduate applicants in 2023, one of the lowest offer rates across the UK. Bsc Economics is the most competitive undergraduate course at the LSE with over 4000 applications for just over 200 places. LLB in Laws comes second with 2600 applications for just over 170 places.[139][140]\\nProspective Postgraduate students applying to the LSE are required to have a first or upper second Class UK honours degree, or its foreign equivalent, for master's degrees, while direct entry to the MPhil/PhD programme requires a UK taught master's with merit, or foreign equivalent. Admission to the diploma requires a UK degree or equivalent plus relevant experience.[141] The intake to applications ratio for postgraduate degree programmes is very competitive; the MSc Financial Mathematics had a ratio of just over 4% in 2016.[142][143]\\n31.6% of LSE's undergraduates are privately educated, the 9th highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.[144] In the 2016-17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 33:18:50 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female-to-male ratio of 52:47.[145]\\nProgrammes and degrees\\n[edit]The school offers over 140 MSc programmes, 5 MPA programmes, one MPP programme, an LLM, 30 BSc programmes, an LLB, 4 BA programmes (including International History and Geography), and 35 PhD programmes.[146][147] Subjects pioneered in Britain by LSE include accountancy and sociology, and the school also employed Britain's first full-time lecturer in economic history.[148] Courses are split across more than thirty research centres and nineteen departments, plus a Language Centre.[149] Lastly, in partnership with the federal University of London, LSE oversees 9 BSc programmes as the lead institution which designs the curriculum.[150] Students who chose to study online experience the same unique academic experience as on-campus, they are considered a part of LSE community and they have a variety of options to interact with their university, such as the LSE general course.[151]\\nSince programmes are all within the social sciences, they closely resemble each other, and undergraduate students usually take at least one course module in a subject outside of their degree for their first and second years of study, promoting a broader education in the social sciences.[152] At undergraduate level, some departments have as few as 90 students across the three years of study.[citation needed] Since September 2010,[citation needed] it has been compulsory for first year undergraduates to participate in LSE 100: Understanding the Causes of Things alongside normal studies.[153]\\nFrom 1902, following its absorption into the University of London, until 2007, all degrees were awarded by the federal university in common with all other colleges of the university. This system was changed in 2007 to enable some colleges to award their own degrees.[citation needed] LSE was granted the power to begin awarding its own degrees from July 2008.[7] All students entering from the 2007\\u201308 academic year onwards received an LSE degree, while students who started before this date were issued University of London degrees.[154][155][156] In conjunction with NYU Stern and HEC Paris, LSE also offers the TRIUM Executive MBA. This was globally ranked third among executive MBAs by the Financial Times in 2016.[157]\\nResearch\\n[edit]According to the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the London School of Economics was rated joint third (along with the University of Cambridge) in the UK for the quality (GPA) of its research.[158] In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, LSE had the joint highest percentage of world-leading research among research submitted of any institution that entered more than one unit of assessment[159] and was ranked third by cumulative grade point average with a score of 3.35, beating both University of Oxford and University of Cambridge.[160] It was ranked 23rd in the country for research power by Research Fortnight based on its REF 2014 results, and 28th in research power by the Times Higher Education.[159][161] This followed the Research Assessment Exercise in 2008 where the school was placed second equal nationally on GPA, first for fraction of world-leading (4*) research and fourth for fraction of world-leading or internationally excellent (3* and 4*) research in LSE's analysis of the results,[162] fourth equal for GPA and 29th for research power in Times Higher Education's analysis,[159] and 27th in research power by Research Fortnight's analysis.[161]\\nAccording to analysis of the REF 2014 subject results by Times Higher Education, the school is the UK's leading research university in terms of GPA of research submitted in business and management; area studies; and communication, cultural and media studies, library and information management, and second in law; politics and international studies; economics and econometrics; and social work and social policy.[163]\\nResearch centres\\n[edit]The school houses a number of centres including the Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion, the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, the Centre for Macroeconomics, the Centre for Economic Performance, LSE Health and Social Care, the Financial Markets Group (founded by former Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King), the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (chaired by Lord Stern), LSE Cities, the UK Department for International Development funded International Growth Centre and one of the six the UK government-backed 'What Works Centres' \\u2013 the What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth. The Greater London Group was an influential research centre within LSE from the late 1950s on, before being subsumed into the LSE London research group.[164] In February 2015, Angelina Jolie and William Hague launched the UK's first academic Centre on Women, Peace and Security, based at the school. The centre aims to contribute to global women's rights issues, including violence against women and women's engagement in politics, through academic research, a post-graduate teaching program, public engagement, and collaboration with international organisations.[165][166] Furthermore, in May 2016 it was announced that Jolie-Pitt and Hague would join Jane Connors and Madeleine Rees as visiting professors in practice from September 2016.[167]\\nLSE IDEAS\\n[edit]LSE IDEAS is a foreign policy think tank at the London School of Economics and Political Science. IDEAS was founded as a think tank for Diplomacy and Strategy in February 2008.[168] It was founded by Professor Michael Cox and Professor Arne Westad. In 2015 it was jointly ranked as world's second-best university think tank for the third year running alongside the LSE Public Policy Group, after Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.[169]\\nPartnerships\\n[edit]LSE has academic partnerships in teaching and research with six universities \\u2013 with Columbia University in New York City and University of California, Berkeley, in Asia with Peking University in Beijing and the National University of Singapore, in Africa with the University of Cape Town, and Europe with Sciences Po in Paris.[170]\\nTogether they offer a range of double or joint degree programmes including an MA in International and World History (with Columbia) and an MSc in international affairs with Peking University, with graduates earning degrees from both institutions.[171] The school also offers joint degrees for specific departments with various other universities including Fudan University in Shanghai, USC in Los Angeles and a Global Studies programme which is offered with a consortium of four European universities \\u2013 Leipzig, Vienna, Roskilde and Wroclaw. It offers the TRIUM Global Executive MBA programme[172] jointly with Stern School of Business of New York University and HEC School of Management, Paris. It is divided into six modules held in five international business locations over a 16-month period. LSE also offers a Dual Master of Public Administration (MPA) with Global Public Policy Network schools such as Sciences Po Paris,[173] the Hertie School of Governance and National University of Singapore, and a dual MPA-Master of Global Affairs (MGA) degree with the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.[174]\\nThe school also runs exchange programmes with a number of international business schools through the Global Master's in Management programme and an undergraduate student exchange programme with the University of California, Berkeley in Political Science. LSE is the only UK member school in the CEMS Alliance, and the LSE Global Master's in Management is the only programme in the UK to offer the CEMS Master's in International Management (CEMS MIM) as a double degree option, allowing students to study at one of 34 CEMS partner universities.[175][176] It also participates in Key Action 1 of the European Union-wide Erasmus+ programme, encouraging staff and student mobility for teaching, although not the other Key Actions in the programme.[177]\\nThe school is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the European University Association,[178] the G5, the Global Alliance in Management Education, the Russell Group and Universities UK,[179] and is sometimes considered part of the 'Golden Triangle' of universities in south-east England, along with the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, University College London, Imperial College London, and King's College London.[180][181][182][183]\\nLSE\\u2019s European Institute offers a Double Degree in European and International Public Policy and Politics with Bocconi University in Milan.[184]\\nLibraries and archives\\n[edit]LSE's main library, the British Library of Political and Economic Science, is located in the Lionel Robbins Building, which reopened in 2001 following a two-year renovation by Foster and Partners. Founded in 1896, it is the world's largest library dedicated to social sciences and the United Kingdom's national social sciences library.[185][186] Its collections are recognised for their national and international significance and hold 'Designation' status by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA).[187] The library welcomes 1.8 million visits per year by students, staff, and the public and contains over 4 million print volumes, 60,000 online journals, and 29,000 electronic books.[188] The Digital Library contains digitised material from LSE Library collections and also born-digital material that has been collected and preserved in digital formats.[189]\\nThe Women's Library, Britain's main library and archive on women and the women's movement, is located in a purpose-built facility with a reading room and exhibition space in the Lionel Robbins Building. The library relocated from London Metropolitan University in 2014.[190][191][192][193]\\nThe Shaw Library, housed in the Founders' Room in the Old Building, contains the school's collection of fiction and general readings. It functions as a general-purpose reading and common room and hosts lunchtime music concerts, press launches, and the Fabian Window, which was unveiled by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2006.[194][195]\\nSeveral subject-specific libraries exist at LSE, including the Seligman Library for Anthropology, the Himmelweit Library for Social Psychology, the Leverhulme Library for Statistics, the Robert McKenzie Library for Sociology, the Michael Wise Library for Geography, and the Gender Institute Library. Additionally, LSE staff and some students are permitted to access and borrow items from Senate House Library, the SOAS Library, and select institutions through the SCONUL Access scheme.[196][197][198]\\nLSE Summer School\\n[edit]The original LSE Summer School was established in 1989 and has since expanded to offer over 70 three-week courses in accounting, finance, economics, English language, international relations, government, law and management each July and August.[199] It is advertised as the largest and one of the most well-established university Summer Schools of its kind in Europe.[200]\\nIn recent years, the school has expanded its summer schools both abroad and into executive education with the LSE-PKU Summer School in Beijing (run with Peking University), the LSE-UCT July School in Cape Town (run with the University of Cape Town) and the Executive Summer School at its London campus. In 2011, it also launched a Methods Summer Programme. Together these courses welcome over 5,000 participants from over 130 countries and some of the top colleges and universities around the world, as well as professionals from several multinational institutions. Participants are housed in LSE halls of residence or their overseas equivalents, and the Summer School provides a full social programme including guest lectures and receptions.[201]\\nPublic lectures\\n[edit]Public lectures hosted by the LSE Events office, are open to students, alumni and the general public. As well as leading academics and commentators, speakers frequently include prominent national and international figures such as ambassadors, CEOs, Members of Parliament, and heads of state. A number of these are broadcast live around the world via the school's website.[202] LSE organises over 200 public events every year.[203]\\nProminent speakers have included Kofi Annan, Ben Bernanke, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Noam Chomsky, Bill Clinton, Philip Craven, Niall Ferguson, Vicente Fox, Milton Friedman, Muammar Gaddafi, Julia Gillard, Alan Greenspan, Tenzin Gyatso, Lee Hsien Loong, Boris Johnson, David Harvey, Jean Tirole, Angelina Jolie, Paul Krugman, Dmitri Medvedev, Mario Monti, George Osborne, Robert Peston, Sebasti\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1era, Kevin Rudd, Jeffrey Sachs, Gerhard Schroeder, Carlos D. Mesa, Luiz In\\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Aung San Suu Kyi, Amartya Sen, George Soros and Rowan Williams. Previously, the school has hosted figures including Nelson Mandela and Margaret Thatcher.[204]\\nThere are also a number of annual lecture series hosted by various departments. These include but are not limited to the Malinowski Memorial Lectures hosted by the department of anthropology, the Lionel Robbins Memorial Lectures and the Ralph Miliband programme.[205]\\nPublishing\\n[edit]In 2018, the university launched LSE Press in partnership with Ubiquity Press. This is intended to publish open-access journals and books in the social sciences. The first journal to be published by the press was the Journal of Illicit Economies and Development, edited by John Collins, executive director of LSE's International Drug Policy Unit. The press is managed through the LSE Library.[206]\\nRankings\\n[edit]National rankings | |\\n---|---|\\nComplete (2025)[207] | 3 |\\nGuardian (2024)[208] | 4 |\\nTimes / Sunday Times (2024)[209] | 4 |\\nGlobal rankings | |\\nARWU (2024)[210] | 151\\u2013200 |\\nQS (2025)[211] | 50= |\\nTHE (2024)[212] | 46 |\\nLSE is ranked third in the UK in the Complete University Guide 2022,[213] fifth in the Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide 2022, and fifth in The Guardian University Guide 2021.[208]\\nIn 2024, the QS World University Rankings placed the LSE among the global top five universities in the subjects of Communication and Media Studies (2nd), Geography (2nd), Philosophy (2nd), Social Policy and Administration (3rd), Development Studies (3rd), History (4th), Sociology (4th) and Politics (5th). It further ranked among the global top ten in Finance, Management, Economics, and Law. Overall, it was ranked 56th internationally.\\nIan Diamond, former chief executive of the Economic and Social Research Council and later vice-chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, a member of the THE editorial board, wrote to Times Higher Education in 2007, saying: \\\"The use of a citation database must have an impact because such databases do not have as wide a cover of the social sciences (or arts and humanities) as the natural sciences. Hence the low position of the London School of Economics, caused primarily by its citations score, is a result not of the output of an outstanding institution but the database and the fact that the LSE does not have the counterweight of a large natural science base.\\\"[214]\\nThe 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings place LSE 8th for social sciences in the world, 11th for business and economics, 14th for law and 35th for arts and humanities, ranking the university 46th globally.[215] The Academic Ranking of World Universities (\\\"Shanghai Ranking\\\") for 2023 ranked LSE 7th in Political Science, 8th in Economics and 8th in Finance, placing it in the 151\\u2013200 range.[216]\\nAccording to data released by the Department for Education in 2018, LSE was rated as the best university for boosting graduate earnings, with male graduates seeing a 47.2% increase in earnings and female graduates seeing a 38.2% increase in earnings compared to the average graduate.[217]\\nAccording to Wealth-X and UBS's \\\"Billionaire Census\\\" in 2014, LSE ranked 10th in the list of 20 schools that have produced the most billionaire alumni.[218] The LSE was the only UK university to make the list.\\nIn the 2020 National Student Survey LSE came 64th out of 154 for overall student satisfaction.[219] The LSE had scored well below its benchmark on this measure in previous years, coming 145th out of 148 in 2017.[220][221] The increase in student satisfaction in 2020 led to a climb of 14 places to fifth in the 2021 Guardian ranking.[222]\\nStudent life\\n[edit]Student body\\n[edit]In the 2015\\u201316 academic year there were 10,833 full-time students and around 700 part-time students at the university. Of these, approximately 7,500 came from outside the United Kingdom (approximately 70% of the total student body), making LSE a highly international school with over 160 countries represented.[223] LSE had more countries represented by students than the UN.[224] 32% of LSE's students come from Asia, 10% from North America, 2% each from South America and Africa. Combined over 100 languages are spoken at LSE.[225] Over half of LSE's students are postgraduates,[226] and there is approximately an equal split between genders with 51% male and 49% female students.[226] Alumni total over 160,000, covering over 190 countries with more than 80 active alumni groups.[9]\\nStudents' Union\\n[edit]The LSE Students' Union (LSESU) is affiliated to the National Union of Students and is responsible for campaigning and lobbying the school on behalf of students as well providing student support and the organisation and undertaking of entertainment events and student societies. It is often regarded as the most politically active in Britain \\u2013 a reputation it has held since the well documented LSE student riots in 1966\\u201367 and 1968\\u201369,[227][228] which made international headlines. In 2015, the school was awarded the top spot for student nightlife by The Guardian newspaper[229] due in part to its central location and provision of over 200 societies, 40 sports clubs, a Raising and Giving (RAG) branch and a thriving media group. In 2013, the union moved into a purpose-built new building \\u2013 the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre on the Aldwych campus.[230]\\nA weekly student newspaper The Beaver, is published each Tuesday during term time and is amongst the oldest student newspapers in the country. It sits alongside a radio station, Pulse! which has existed since 1999 and a television station LooSE Television since 2005. The Clare Market Review one of Britain's oldest student publications was revived in 2008.[231] Over \\u00a3150,000 is raised for charity each year through the RAG (Raising and Giving), the fundraising arm of the Students' Union,[232] which was started in 1980 by then Student Union Entertainments Officer and former New Zealand MP Tim Barnett.[233]\\nSporting activity is coordinated by the LSE Athletics Union, which is a constituent of British Universities & Colleges Sport (BUCS).[231]\\nStudent housing\\n[edit]LSE owns or operates 10 halls of residence in and around central London and there are also two halls owned by urbanest and five intercollegiate halls (shared with other constituent colleges of the University of London) within a 3-mile radius of the school, for a total of over 4,000 places.[234] Most residences take both undergraduates and postgraduates, although Carr-Saunders Hall and Passfield Hall are undergraduate only, and Butler's Wharf Residence, Grosvenor House and Lillian Knowles House are reserved for postgraduates. Sidney Webb House, managed by Unite Students, takes postgraduates and continuing students.[235] There are also flats available on Anson and Carleton roads, which are reserved for students with children.[236]\\nThe school guarantees accommodation for all first-year undergraduate students and many of the school's larger postgraduate population are also catered for, with some specific residences available for postgraduate living.[237] Whilst none of the residences are located at the Aldwych campus, the closest, Grosvenor House is within a five-minute walk from the school in Covent Garden, whilst the farthest residences (Nutford and Butler's Wharf) are approximately forty-five minutes by Tube or Bus.\\nEach residence accommodates a mixture of students both home and international, male and female, and, usually, undergraduate and postgraduate. New undergraduate students (including General Course students) occupy approximately 55% of all spaces, with postgraduates taking approximately 40% and continuing students about 5% of places.[237]\\nThe largest LSE student residence, Bankside House, a refurbished early 1950s office block and former headquarters of the Central Electricity Generating Board,[238] opened to students in 1996 and is fully catered, accommodating 617 students across eight floors overlooking the River Thames. It is located behind the Tate Modern art gallery on the south bank of the river.[239][240] The second-largest residence, the High Holborn Residence in High Holborn, was opened in 1995 and is approximately 10 minutes walk from the main campus. It is self-catering, accommodating 447 students in flats of four our five bedrooms with shared facilities.[241]\\nNotable people\\n[edit]-\\nJomo Kenyatta, President of Kenya (1964\\u20131978)\\n-\\nK.

The first notable mention of the LSE was in literature was in the epilogue to Bernard Shaw's 1912 play Pygmalion, Eliza Doolittle is sent to the LSE.[247]\\nIn around a dozen other novels, the LSE was mentioned as short-hand for a character being witty and clever but outside the establishment. This is best exhibited by Ian Fleming's CV of James Bond that included the detail that his father, Andrew, is an LSE graduate.[248] These occurrences have continued into contemporary fiction: Lenny is the young 'hip' LSE graduate and criminologist in Jake Arnott's tour of the London underworld in The Long Firm. Robert Harris' Enigma includes Baxter, a code breaker with leftist views, who has been an LSE lecturer before the war and My Revolutions by Hari Kunzru traces the career of Chris Carver aka Michael Frame who travels from LSE student radical to terrorist and on to middle England.[248]\\nLSE alumna Hilary Mantel, in The Experience of Love, never mentions LSE by name but Houghton Street, the corridors of the LSE Old Building and Wright's Bar are immediately recognisable references to the campus of the school. A. S. Byatt's The Children's Book returns to LSE's Fabian roots with a plot inspired in part by the life of children's writer E. Nesbitt and Fabian Hubert Bland, and characters that choose LSE over older educational establishments (namely Oxford and Cambridge).\\nOn the small screen, the popular 1980s British sitcom Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister make regular references to the LSE with Minister Jim Hacker (later Prime Minister) and Sir Mark Spencer (special advisor to the Prime Minister) regularly being subtly ridiculed for having attended the LSE.[249] A fictional LSE graduate also appears in season three episode six of the US series, Mad Men.[249] The popular American series The West Wing following the Democratic administration of Josiah (Jed) Bartlet makes several references to Josiah Bartlet being an alumnus of the LSE.[249] Other fictional LSE alumni are present in Spooks, at least one episode of The Professionals and The Blacklist series.\\nIn movies and motion pictures, in the 2014 action spy thriller Shadow Recruit, the young Jack Ryan, based on a Tom Clancy character, proves his academic credentials by walking out of the Old Building as he graduates from the LSE before injuring his spine being shot down in Afghanistan.[249] The LSE is acknowledged in The Social Network naming the institution along with Oxford and Cambridge universities in a reference to the rapid growth Facebook enjoyed both within and outside the United States in its early years.\\nSee also\\n[edit]Notes\\n[edit]- ^ Includes those who indicate that they identify as Asian, Black, Mixed Heritage, Arab or any other ethnicity except White.\\n- ^ Calculated from the Polar4 measure, using Quintile1, in England and Wales.

This name for the basilica had become popular in the 14th century[4] in connection with a legend that c. 352, during \\\"the pontificate of Liberius, a Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a vow to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary. They prayed that she might make known to them how they were to dispose of their property in her honor. On 5 August, at the height of the Roman summer, snow fell during the night on the summit of the Esquiline Hill. In obedience to a vision of the Virgin Mary which they had the same night, the couple built a basilica in honor of Mary on the very spot which was covered with snow.[5]\\nThe legend is first reported only after the year 1000.[6] It may be implied in what the Liber Pontificalis of the early 13th century says of Pope Liberius: \\\"He built the basilica of his own name near the Macellum of Livia\\\".[7] It is shown in the early 15th-century painting of the Miracle of the Snow by Masolino da Panicale.[8][b]\\nThe feast was originally called Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae (Dedication of Saint Mary's),[9] and was celebrated only in Rome until it was inserted into the General Roman Calendar, with ad Nives added to its name, in 1568.[4] A congregation appointed by Pope Benedict XIV in 1741 proposed that the reading of the legend be struck from the Office and that the feast be given its original name.[9] No action was taken on the proposal until 1969, when the reading of the legend was removed and the feast was called In dedicatione Basilicae S. Mariae (Dedication of the Basilica of Saint Mary).[4] The legend is still commemorated by dropping white rose petals from the dome during the celebration of the Mass and during the Second Vespers on the feast day.\\nThe earliest building on the site was the Liberian Basilica or Santa Maria Liberiana, after Pope Liberius (352\\u2013366). This name may have originated from the same legend, which recounts that, like John and his wife, Pope Liberius was told in a dream of the forthcoming summer snowfall, went in procession to where it occurred and there marked out the area on which the church was to be built.[10] Liberiana is still included in some versions of the basilica's name, and \\\"Liberian Basilica\\\" may be used as a contemporary as well as historical name.[c]\\nOn the other hand, the name \\\"Liberian Basilica\\\" may be independent of the legend, since, according to Pius Parsch, Pope Liberius transformed a palace of the Sicinini family into a church, which was for that reason called the \\\"Sicinini Basilica\\\". This building was then replaced under Pope Sixtus III (432\\u2013440) by the present structure dedicated to Mary.[10] However, some sources say that the adaptation as a church of a pre-existing building on the site of the present basilica was done in the 420s under Pope Celestine I, the immediate predecessor of Sixtus III.[11]\\nLong before the earliest traces of the story of the miraculous snow, the church now known as Saint Mary Major was called \\\"Saint Mary of the Crib\\\" (\\\"Sancta Maria ad Praesepe\\\"),[12] a name it was given because of its relic of the crib or manger of the Nativity of Jesus Christ, four boards of sycamore wood believed to have been brought to the church, together with a fifth, in the time of Pope Theodore I (640\\u2013649).[13][14] This name appears in the Tridentine editions of the Roman Missal as the place for the pope's Mass (the station Mass) on Christmas Night,[15] while the name \\\"Mary Major\\\" appears for the church of the station Mass on Christmas Day.[16]\\nStatus as a papal major basilica\\n[edit]No Catholic church can be honored with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom.[17] St. Mary Major is one of the only four that hold the title of \\\"major basilica\\\". The other three are the basilicas of St. John in the Lateran, St. Peter, and St. Paul outside the Walls.[18] The title of major basilica was once used more widely, being attached, for instance, to the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels in Assisi).[19] Along with the other major basilicas, St. Mary Major is also styled a \\\"papal basilica\\\". Before 2006, the four papal major basilicas, together with the Basilica of St. Lawrence outside the Walls were referred to as the \\\"patriarchal basilicas\\\" of Rome,{{efn|When Pope Benedict XVI abandoned the title \\\"Patriarch of the West\\\", the title of St. Mary Major changed from patriarchal to papal basilica, as found on its website,[20] and each was associated with one of the five ancient patriarchates. St. Mary Major was associated with the Patriarchate of Antioch.[21]\\nThe five papal basilicas along with the Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem and San Sebastiano fuori le mura were the traditional Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome, which were visited by pilgrims during their pilgrimage to Rome following a 20-kilometer (12 mi) itinerary established by Philip Neri on 25 February 1552.[22][23][24]\\nHistory\\n[edit]It is now agreed that the present church was built on the Cispian spur of Rome's Esquiline Hill under Pope Celestine I (422\\u2013432) not under Pope Sixtus III (432\\u2013440), who consecrated the basilica on 5 August 434 to the Virgin Mary.\\nThe dedicatory inscription on the triumphal arch, Latin: Sixtus Episcopus plebi Dei (Sixtus the bishop to the people of God), is an indication of that Pope's role in the construction.[25] As well as this church on the summit of the Esquiline Hill, Pope Sixtus III is said to have commissioned extensive building projects throughout the city, which were continued by his successor Pope Leo I, the Great.[26]\\nThe church retains the core of its original structure, despite several additional construction projects and damage by the earthquake of 1348.\\nChurch building in Rome in this period, as exemplified in Santa Maria Maggiore, was inspired by the idea of Rome being not just the center of the world of the Roman Empire, as it was seen in the classical period, but the center of the Christian world.[27]\\nSanta Maria Maggiore, one of the first churches built to celebrate the Virgin Mary, was erected immediately after the Council of Ephesus of 431, which proclaimed Mary Mother of God. Pope Sixtus III built it to commemorate this decision.[28][29] Certainly, the atmosphere that generated the council gave rise also to the mosaics that adorn the interior of the dedication: \\\"whatever the precise connection was between council and church it is clear that the planners of the decoration belong to a period of concentrated debates on nature and status of the Virgin and incarnate Christ.\\\"[30] The magnificent mosaics of the nave and triumphal arch, seen as \\\"milestones in the depiction\\\" of the Virgin,[31] depict scenes of her life and that of Christ, but also scenes from the Old Testament: Moses striking the Red Sea, and Egyptians drowning in the Red Sea.\\nRichard Krautheimer attributes the magnificence of the work also to the abundant revenue accruing to the papacy at the time from land holdings acquired by the Catholic Church during the 4th and 5th centuries on the Italian peninsula: \\\"Some of these holdings were locally controlled; the majority as early as the end of the 5th century were administered directly from Rome with great efficiency: a central accounting system was involved in the papal chancery; and a budget was apparently prepared, one part of the income going to the papal administration, another to the needs of the clergy, a third to the maintenance of church buildings, a fourth to charity. These fines enabled the papacy to carry out through the 5th century an ambitious building program, including Santa Maria Maggiore.\\\"[32]\\nMiri Rubin believes that the building of the basilica was influenced also by seeing Mary as one who could represent the imperial ideals of classical Rome, bringing together the old Rome and the new Christian Rome: \\\"In Rome, the city of martyrs, if no longer of emperors, Mary was a figure that could credibly carry imperial memories and representations.\\\"[33]\\nGregory the Great may have been inspired by Byzantine devotions to the Theotokos (Mother of God) when after becoming Pope during a plague in 590 that had taken the life of his predecessor, he ordered for seven processions to march through the city of Rome chanting Psalms and Kyrie Eleison, in order to appease the wrath of God. The processions began in different parts of the city, but rather than finally converging on St Peter's, who was always the traditional protector of Rome, he instead ordered the processions to converge on Mary Major instead.[34]\\nWhen the popes returned to Rome after the period of the Avignon papacy, the buildings of the basilica became a temporary Palace of the Popes[citation needed] due to the deteriorated state of the Lateran Palace. The papal residence was later moved to the Palace of the Vatican in what is now Vatican City.\\nThe basilica was restored, redecorated and extended by various popes, including Eugene III (1145\\u20131153), Nicholas IV (1288\\u201392), Clement X (1670\\u201376), and Benedict XIV (1740\\u201358), who in the 1740s commissioned Ferdinando Fuga to build the present fa\\u00e7ade and to modify the interior. The interior of the Santa Maria Maggiore underwent a broad renovation encompassing all of its altars between the years 1575 and 1630.\\nIn 1966, archeologists excavating under the basilica found the remains of a Roman building including an imperial calendar with fasti and agricultural annotations and illustrations.[35] On the basis of the calendar, the ruins have been dated to c. 200 by Salzman[36] and to the 4th century by Magi.[37]\\nOn 15 December 2015, two homeless Arab men attempted to disarm soldiers outside the basilica while yelling the takbir \\\"God is great\\\". The 30 and 40 year old Palestinian and Tunisian called for others to help them as they threatened and assaulted the soldiers and police, but were arrested.[38]\\nArchitecture\\n[edit]The original architecture of Santa Maria Maggiore was classical and traditionally Roman, perhaps to convey the idea that Santa Maria Maggiore represented old imperial Rome as well as its Christian future. As one scholar puts it, \\\"Santa Maria Maggiore so closely resembles a second-century imperial basilica that it has sometimes been thought to have been adapted from a basilica for use as a Christian church. Its plan was based on Hellenistic principles stated by Vitruvius at the time of Augustus.\\\"[39]\\nEven though Santa Maria Maggiore is immense in its area, it was built to plan. The design of the basilica was a typical one during this time in Rome: \\\"a tall and wide nave; an aisle on either side; and a semicircular apse at the end of the nave.\\\"[27] The key aspect that made Santa Maria Maggiore such a significant cornerstone in church building during the early 5th century were the beautiful mosaics found on the triumphal arch and nave. [citation needed]\\nThe Athenian marble columns supporting the nave are even older, and either come from the first basilica, or from another antique Roman building; thirty-six are marble and four granite, pared down, or shortened to make them identical by Ferdinando Fuga, who provided them with identical gilt-bronze capitals.[40] The 14th-century campanile, or bell tower, is the highest in Rome, at 246 feet, (about 75 m.). The basilica's 16th-century coffered ceiling, to a design by Giuliano da Sangallo, is said to be gilded with gold, initially brought by Christopher Columbus, presented by Ferdinand and Isabella to the Spanish pope, Alexander VI.[41] The apse mosaic, the Coronation of the Virgin, is from 1295, signed by the Franciscan friar, Jacopo Torriti. The Basilica also contains frescoes by Giovanni Baglione, in the Cappella Borghese. [citation needed]\\nThe 12th-century fa\\u00e7ade has been masked by a reconstruction, with a screening loggia, that was added by Pope Benedict XIV in 1743, to designs by Ferdinando Fuga that did not damage the mosaics of the fa\\u00e7ade. The wing of the canonica (sacristy) to its left and a matching wing to the right (designed by Flaminio Ponzio) give the basilica's front the aspect of a palace facing the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore. To the right of the Basilica's fa\\u00e7ade is a memorial constituting a column in the form of an up-ended cannon barrel topped with a cross: it was erected by Pope Clement VIII to celebrate the end of the French Wars of Religion.[42]\\nIn the piazza in front of the facade rises a column with a Corinthian capital, topped with a statue of the Virgin and the child Jesus. This Marian column was erected in 1614 to the designs of Carlo Maderno during the papacy of Paul V. Maderno's fountain at the base combines the armorial eagles and dragons of Paul V (Borghese). The column itself was the sole intact remainder from the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine in the Roman Forum.[d] The statue atop the column was made by Domenico Ferri. In a papal bull from the year of its installation, the pope decreed three years of indulgences to those who uttered a prayer to the Virgin while saluting the column.[43]\\nInterior\\n[edit]Fifth-century mosaics\\n[edit]The mosaics found in Santa Maria Maggiore are one of the oldest representations of the Virgin Mary in Christian late antiquity. As one scholar puts it, \\\"This is well demonstrated by the decoration of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome,... where the iconographic depiction of the Virgin Mary was chosen at least in part to celebrate the affirmation of Mary as Theotokos (bearer of God) by the third ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431 CE.\\\"[44] The mosaics of the triumphal arch and the nave in Santa Maria Maggiore gave a model for the future representations of the Virgin Mary. The influences of these mosaics are rooted in late antique impressionism that could be seen in frescoes, manuscript paintings and many pavement mosaics across villas in Africa, Syria and Sicily during the 5th century.[25] This being said, the crowning of Mary on the Apse was made much later by Torriti by commission of Pope Nicholas IV. (13th century).[45]\\nThese mosaics gave historians insight into artistic, religious, and social movements during this time. As Margaret Miles explains the mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore have two goals: one to glorify the Virgin Mary as Theotokos (God-Bearer); and the other to present \\\"a systematic and comprehensive articulation of the relationship of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian scriptures as one in which the Hebrew Bible foreshadows Christianity.\\\"[46] This is explained by the dual images of Old Testament and New Testament events depicted in the mosaics of the triumphal arch and the nave. The mosaics also show the range of artistic expertise and refute the theory that mosaic technique during the time was based on copying from model books. The mosaics found in Santa Maria Maggiore are combinations of different styles of mosaic art during the time, according to art scholar Robin Cormack: \\\"the range of artistic expertise and the actual complexities of production can hardly be reduced to a mentality of copying. A test case is given by the mosaics of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome\\\".[30]\\nTriumphal arch\\n[edit]The triumphal arch at the head of the nave was at first referred to as the apse arch, but later became known as the triumphal arch.[47] The triumphal arch is illustrated with magnificent mosaics depicting different scenes of Christ and the Virgin Mary. There was a difference in the styles used in the triumphal arch mosaics compared to those of the nave; the style of the triumphal arch was much more linear and flat as one scholar describes it, not nearly as much action, emotion and movement in them as there were in the Old Testament mosaics of the nave.[30] One of the first scenes that were visible on the triumphal arch was a panel of Christ's enthronement with a group of angels as his court. As one historian describes it: \\\"On the apse arch Christ is enthroned, a young emperor attended by four chamberlains, angels of course\\\",[27] this is a perfect example of mosaic art in the 5th century. Another panel found on the triumphal arch is of the Virgin, she is crowned and dressed in a colorful veil, her wardrobe subtly brings to mind that of a Roman empress and in this panel she has her divine son walking with her and a suite of angels and Joseph ready to greet her; \\\"The Virgin...shows to perfection the impressionistic character of mosaics.\\\"[48] Another panel is known as the Adoration of the Magi and this mosaic depicts Infant Christ and The Virgin and the arrival of the three wise men, \\\"mosaics illustrating Christ's first coming and his youth covered the triumphal arch.\\\"[48] The other panel depicts the Virgin accompanied by five martyrs.[25]\\nNave\\n[edit]The nave of the basilica was covered in mosaics representing Old Testament events of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt across the Red Sea. \\\"The nave mosaics (which represents stories of Old Testament history and accordingly offered Christians in Rome a new 'past') are illusionistic in a colorful and impressionist manner\\\"[30] as this scholar puts it the scene was filled with movement, emotion, and it was to inspire thinking of Rome's \\\"new\\\" past; the past of the Old Testament. As one scholar describes it: \\\"Moses strikes the waters of the Red Sea in a heroic gesture, his toga in light and dark grays and blues, but lined in black, the folds white lines, the tunic underneath light blue; the man next to him wears a deep blue toga over a gray and white tunic.\\\"[25] Another panel shows the demise of the Egyptians in the Red Sea. An observer describes the mosaic: \\\"The Egyptians, clad in blue armor with gold bands and scarlet cloaks wildly flying, drown in the greenish-blue waters; the horses, white or light brown shaded with darker browns, highlighted in white, the accoutrements a bright red.\\\"[48]\\nCappella Sistina and Crypt of the Nativity\\n[edit]Under the high altar of the basilica is the Crypt of the Nativity or Bethlehem Crypt, with a crystal reliquary designed by Giuseppe Valadier said to contain wood from the Holy Crib of the nativity of Jesus Christ.[49] Here is the burial place of Jerome, the 4th-century Doctor of the Church who translated the Bible into the Latin language (the Vulgate).[50]\\nFragments of the sculpture of the Nativity believed to be by 13th-century Arnolfo di Cambio were transferred to beneath the altar of the large Sistine Chapel[49] off the right transept of the church. This chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is named after Pope Sixtus V, and is not to be confused with the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican, named after Pope Sixtus IV. The architect Domenico Fontana designed the chapel, which contains the tombs of Sixtus V himself and of his early patron Pope Pius V. The main altar in the chapel has four gilded bronze angels by Sebastiano Torregiani, holding up the ciborium, which is a model of the chapel itself.\\nBeneath this altar is the Oratory or Chapel of the Nativity, on whose altar, at that time situated in the Crypt of the Nativity below the main altar of the church itself, Ignatius of Loyola celebrated his first Mass as a priest on 25 December 1538.\\nJust outside the Sistine Chapel is the tomb of Gianlorenzo Bernini and his family.[50]\\nThe Mannerist interior decoration of the Sistine Chapel was completed (1587\\u20131589) by a large team of artists, directed by Cesare Nebbia and Giovanni Guerra. While the art biographer, Giovanni Baglione allocates specific works to individual artists, recent scholarship finds that the hand of Nebbia drew preliminary sketches for many, if not all, of the frescoes. Baglione also concedes the roles of Nebbia and Guerra could be summarized as \\\"Nebbia drew, and Guerra supervised the teams\\\".[citation needed]\\nPainter | Work |\\n---|---|\\nGiovanni Battista Pozzo | Angelic Glory, Visitation, Annunciation, Joseph's dream, St. Paul & John Evangelist, St. Peter enters Rome,& Massacre of infants |\\nLattanzio Mainardi | Tamar, Fares, Zara, Solomon, & Boaz |\\nHendrick van den Broeck (Arrigo Fiammingo) | Esrom, Aram, Aminabad & Naassom |\\nParis Nogari | Ruth, Jesse, David, Solomon & Roboam; & the Holy Family |\\nGiacomo Stella | Jehoshaphat & Jehoram, Jacob, Judah & his brothers, Sacrifice of Isacc |\\nAngiolo Nebbia | Ozias & Jonathan, Abiud and Eliacim, Manassah and Amon, Josiah and Jechonia, Salatiele & Zorobabel |\\nSalvatore Fontana | Jacob, Eli, Eliezer and Nathan, Herod orders massacre of the innocents, Annunciation |\\nCesare Nebbia | Chaziel & Ezekias, Sadoch, Achim, Amoz |\\nErcole from Bologna | Flight from Egypt and Mary visits Elisabeth's house |\\nAndrea Lilio | Magi before Herod |\\nOthers include Ferdinando Sermei, Giacomo Stella, Paul Bril, and Ferra\\u00f9 Fenzoni.[51]\\nCappella Paolina (or Borghese Chapel) and Salus Populi Romani\\n[edit]The column in the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore celebrates the famous icon of the Virgin Mary now enshrined in the Borghese Chapel of the basilica. It is known as \\\"Salus Populi Romani\\\", or \\\"Health of the Roman People\\\" or \\\"Salvation of the Roman People\\\", due to a miracle in which the icon reportedly helped keep plague from the city. The icon is at least a thousand years old, and according to a tradition was painted from life by St Luke the Evangelist using the wooden table of the Holy Family in Nazareth.\\nThe \\\"Salus Populi Romani\\\" has been praised by several popes and acted as a key Mariological symbol.\\nPrior to becoming the Pope Pius XII, Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli celebrated his first Catholic Mass before the image inside the Borghese Chapel on Easter Sunday, 2 April 1899. In December 1953, the icon was carried through Rome to initiate the first Marian year. On 1 November 1954, the icon was translated and officially crowned by Pope Pius XII at Basilica of Saint Peter as he gave a personal speech and introduced a new Marian feast Queenship of Mary.\\nFuture pontiffs Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, and Pope Francis all visited the \\\"Salus Populi Romani\\\" and led liturgical celebrations.\\nPapal basilica\\n[edit]As a papal basilica, Santa Maria Maggiore is often used by the pope. He presides over the rites for the annual Feast of the Assumption of Mary on 15 August there. Except for a few priests and the basilica's archpriest, the canopied high altar is reserved for use by the pope alone. Pope Francis visited the basilica on the day after his election.[52]\\nThe pope gives charge of the basilica to an archpriest, usually a cardinal. Formerly, the archpriest was the titular Latin Patriarch of Antioch, a title abolished in 1964. Since 29 December 2016, the archpriest has been Stanis\\u0142aw Ry\\u0142ko.\\nIn addition to the archpriest and his assistant priests, a chapter of canons is resident. Redemptorist, Dominican and Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate priests serve the church.\\nThe King of Spain, currently Felipe VI, is ex officio protocanon of the basilica's chapter.[53]\\nPope Francis visits the Basilica often, mainly to visit the Salus Populi Romani. He visits before and after trips outside the Vatican, calling the icon his \\\"great devotion\\\". He has also constructed a tomb next to the icon to be his final resting place upon his death. Francis plans to be the first pope to be interred outside the Vatican since Pope Leo XIII in 1903.[54]\\nArchpriests of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore since 1127\\n[edit]List of archpriests since 1127.[55][56][57][58][59][e]\\n- Rainiero (attested 1127\\u20131130)\\n- Matteo (attested 1153)\\n- Paolo Scolari (attested 1176\\u20131187)\\n- Rolando (attested 1189\\u20131193)\\n- Pietro Sasso (attested 1212)[f]\\n- Romano (attested 1222)\\n- Astor (attested 1244)\\n- Pietro Capocci (?)

Pudenziana (1206\\u20131218/19). However, this identification remains uncertain because the only document which mentions this archpriest (dated 3 July 1212) makes no reference to his cardinalate, cf. Ferri in ASRSP, vol. 28, p. 24.\\n- ^ Cardinal Pietro Capocci (died 1259) is mentioned in the majority of the catalogs of archpriests of Liberian Basilica but the documents from the archive of the Basilica, published by Ferri in ASRSP, vol. 27, p. 34\\u201339 and vol. 30, p. 119, give no support for this affirmation. Document dated 19 March 1244 mentions Astor (or Aston) as archpriest, documents between 13 February 1247 and 1 October 1255 mention archpriest without mentioning his name but also without indicating his cardinalate, and on 28 May 1258 Romano was archpriest of the Basilica; the latest document mentions also cardinal Pietro Capocci but makes no reference to his occupation of that post. If he was really an archpriest under Innocent IV, he must have later resigned, but it seems more likely that this statement resulted from a confusion.\\nReferences\\n[edit]Citations\\n[edit]- ^ \\\"Historic Centre of Rome, the Properties of the Holy See in that City Enjoying Extraterritorial Rights and San Paolo Fuori le Mura\\\".

Ltd. |\\n---|---|\\nFounded | 1924 Melbourne |\\nDefunct | 30 June 1932 |\\nSuccessor | Australian Broadcasting Corporation |\\nHeadquarters | Australia |\\nOwner | Farmer & Company J. C. Williamson Limited J. & N. Tait Others |\\nThe Australian Broadcasting Company Pty. Ltd. was a short-lived Australian commercial broadcasting company set up by Sir Benjamin Fuller and Frank Albert. Founded in Melbourne in 1924 with a capital of \\u00a3A 100,000 by a consortium of entertainment interests, notably Farmer & Company, J. C. Williamson Limited and J. & N. Tait to found and operate commercial radio broadcasting stations.[1] Other major shareholders, perhaps later entrants, were Union Theatres Limited, B & J. Fuller and J. Albert & Son. Directors were Stuart Doyle, Frank Albert and Sir Benjamin Fuller.[2]\\nThe Sealed Set system\\n[edit]When the ABC was established in 1923, they adopted the 'sealed set' scheme as its source of income (see main article). 1,400 \\\"sealed\\\" receivers were sold, each fixed to receive one of four radio stations, before the system was abandoned, at least partly due to the ease with which it could be circumvented.[3]\\nIn 1924 a new system was introduced, where radio stations were divided into two categories, class A and class B, Each drawing funding in different ways.[3]\\nLicensing\\n[edit]In 1929 the company won the contract to supply radio programmes for broadcast on the \\\"A-class\\\" transmitters contracted to the Federal Government's National Broadcasting Service.[2] The Royal Commission of 1927 had recommended full nationalisation in the style of the BBC, but the conservative government of the time chose this out-sourced approach instead. As each of the \\\"A-class\\\" licences expired during 1929 and 1930, the Commonwealth acquired and then maintained the station's transmitters and studios through the Postmaster-General's Department, while the programming was supplied by the Australian Broadcasting Company.[4]\\nThe ABC was originally funded through Licence fees which enabled radio programming. Listeners had to purchase a licence to be able to listen to the radio broadcast. From the 1920s to the 1970s, the earnings from these licences were used to finance the production of radio and television services.[5]\\nA Class\\n[edit]Class A stations were funded by licence fees paid by listeners, as well as by limited advertising. In 1929, the Australian Government acquired all class A stations, which were henceforth operated by the Postmaster-General's Department.[3] There were originally eight class A stations and most of the time, they aired talks, plays, and music, either broadcast live from the studio or another place connected to a station by telephone lines (\\\"Outside Broadcasts\\\"). The ABC would broadcast 'stunts' to influence the purchasing of licences, which financially benefited the A class stations and equipment shareholders would sell.[6]\\nOf all the stations broadcast by the ABC, station 3LO was the most profitable. Located in Melbourne, Victoria, 3LO was both an A-class and B-class radio station. Licence revenues for the station were immediately returned to the broadcasters after the government removed deductions and fulfilled royalty payments to the AWA. In 1928, a senior colleague working for 3LO estimated that the station was making an annual profit of around AUD 90,000 - in comparison to its initial investment of AUD 11,500.[6] According to Inglis, not all stations did nearly as well as 3LO. 6WF located in Perth wasn't doing well in 1926. The station was aimed at country people, but the farming families who would hear its programs didn't resonate with its content. This meant that not many in the WA audience held radio licences. In 1928, the Post Master General's office had to rescue 6WF by buying its land, renting its premises, and paying staff to keep working. 6WF was the first radio station managed by the Government, due to its lack of succession.[6]\\nControversy\\n[edit]In 1927, a Royal Commission was instituted by the Federal Government due to audience dissatisfaction. The outcome was that the Australian Broadcasting Company would provide radio content under the new National Broadcasting Service (NBS).[7]\\nB Class\\n[edit]Class B was purely funded by advertising, with its first radio station being 2BE Sydney.[8] According to Jones in 1995, many B-class radio stations struggled. This included 2BE Sydney, which closed down in April 1929 due to its lack of consistent broadcasting.[7] 2MK Bathurst followed by closing in December 1930. After inquiries as to why the station had been closed down, the Postmaster General's Department released a statement ensuring it was for the better, saying that \\\"Exceptional care has been exercised by the Department in the expansion of broadcasting services to the Commonwealth so that listeners might enjoy the greatest possible selection of programs without undue risk of interference in reception between one station and another.\\\"[7]\\nThe Postmaster General's department also ensured that the Australian Broadcasting Company would provide exceptional service and maintain a high standard. According to Jones in 1995, the ABC should 'do all in its power to cultivate a public desire for transmission of educational items, musical items of merit and, generally, for all items and subjects which tend to elevate the mind.'[7]\\nFollowing the Department's statement in response to the B class radio stations, the ABC was subject to rules, requiring the company to avoid tedious broadcasting repetition of an artist in a particular state.[7] These rules were in the contract of the company with the department.\\nFollowing the disruption to 6WF, Chairman Harry Brown advocated for a C class station. It would be run by the Post Master General's office and made available for public audiences such as organisations or firms. Due to its lack of popularity, a C class station never came into existence.[7]\\n1929 marked the five-year anniversary of A and B class stations. At the time, 301199 listener licences were held, and twenty radio stations were on air.[7]\\nAccording to Jones, 40% of listeners were located in Victoria. As the Great Depression began, 14 stations came on the air from 1930-1930, to keep the Australian public informed. However, only three of these stations were owned by the Australian Broadcasting Company. This was due to ABC's struggle to return a profit, due to all of its resources going to regional stations in Newcastle, Rockhampton, and Albury. Port Pirie was the location of the ABC's last regional station.\\nIn May 1932, the government passed the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act, marking the fourth major change to broadcasting in just ten years. Postmaster General Department's director Harry Brown had decided a national broadcasting system would be more appropriate for the nation. Required by the new Act, the ABC commission was to take over the studios of the company and 'broadcast from the National Broadcasting Stations adequate and comprehensive programs in the interests of the community.[7]\\nThe contract with the Australian Broadcasting Company expired on 30 June 1932 and thereafter programming for the National Broadcasting Service was provided by the newly established Australian Broadcasting Commission, now the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which purchased the assets of the earlier ABC.\\nRadio Stations\\n[edit]Under the NBS, the following stations were broadcasting:\\n- 2BL located in Sydney, NSW\\n- 2FC located in Sydney, NSW\\n- 2NC located in Newcastle, NSW\\n- 3AR located in Melbourne, VIC\\n- 3LO located in Melbourne, VIC\\n- 4QG located in Brisbane, QLD\\n- 5CL located in Adelaide, SA\\n- 6WF located in Perth, WA[9]\\nThe Australian Broadcasting Commission acquired the Company. On the 1 July 1932 radio announcer Conrad Charlton began the day's broadcast at 2BL and/or 2FC, saying; \\\"This is the Australian Broadcasting Commission.\\\" At 8pm the Commission was formally opened by the Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, speaking from Canberra. Lyons proclaimed his strategic direction for the company, saying its purpose was to provide 'information, entertainment, culture, and gaiety and serve all diversified tastes of the Australian Public.'[6]\\nThe 1932 Opposition Leader, James Scullin also stated the company's other main purpose which was to ensure that broadcasting under national control must not encourage misrepresentation or suppression. As Dr. Earle Page, leader of Country Party said, radio was indeed a luxury in Australia, but a necessity for farmers who used broadcasting information to set prices for their produce.\\nThe ABC remains Australia's only advertisement-free and public broadcaster with almost twenty million viewers and listeners per week. The Scullin Labor government at the time passed the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act 1932 in response to the mishandling of the 1927 royal commission.[10] Upon the acquisition, the radio station broadcast did not change, they were just now the responsibility of the ABC Commission. Formally, they were the responsibility of the ABC company. Most of the ABC companies 250 workers chose to stay and work for the new commission. Company manager C.F. Marden decided to move to 2UW and join Doyle, Fuller and Albert.[7]\\nRadio Announcers\\n[edit]Charles Moses\\n[edit]Sir Charles Moses CBE joined the Australian Broadcasting Company in 1929, and was General Manager from 1935 to 1965. Based in the Melbourne office, he used his voice on air for B class radio stations. According to ABC manager at the time Bernard Heinze, Moses had the perfect voice for broadcasting. Moses began commentating for ice hockey soon after his voice audition.[11]\\nIn August 1930, Moses was promoted to an announcer, where he earned seven pounds per week. For the time, this was double the minimum wage. He worked a total of fifty hours per week at the ABC. By mid-1932, he was earning eight pounds per week. He achieved this by arranging announcer rosters and coordinating news sessions. He also earned this money by describing sports and doing fifteen-minute news commentary up to three times per week. By the time the ABC commission Act came into effect, Moses was 32 years old and decided to take a job with the commission.[11]\\nPrior to taking on a managerial role, he was primarily a sports commentator.\\nConrad Charlton\\n[edit]\\\"Con\\\" Charlton was the first Chief Announcer. His two sons, Tony and Michael, also became broadcast personalities: Tony as a sports commentator on commercial television and Michael on ABC-TV.[12]\\nMel Morris\\n[edit]Mel Morris was primarily a sports commentator.[12]\\nBobby Bluegum\\n[edit]Bobby Bluegum was the nom-de-plume of Frank Hatherley. He was the first children's session presenter.[12]\\nAlfred (Alf) Andrew\\n[edit]Alf Andrew was one of the ABC's first broadcasters. He later broadcast on 3UZ, 2UW and 3AK.[12]\\nRupert Hazell\\n[edit]Rupert Hazell, a pioneer broadcaster at Melbourne's 3LO, was dismissed in 1926 for producing two 78 rpm (or actually 80 rpm) recordings under the title, \\\"3.O.L. (A Radio Fan's Dream)\\\". These were spoofs on 3LO's contemporary style of broadcasting.[13] Although they were a send-up, ironically they give contemporary listeners an insight into what radio sounded like in its early days.[14][15]\\nSee also\\n[edit]References\\n[edit]Inline citations\\n[edit]- ^ \\\"Radio Broadcasting\\\".
